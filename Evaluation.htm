        <h4>Participants</h4>
    <p>There were in total 6 graduate students participated in the user test at this stage. Among them, there were 2 female and 4 females. The degrees that they are pursuing right now are Master’s (2) and PhD (4). Most of them are in the program of Human Computer Interaction except one has a major of Integrated Visual Arts (IVA). The familiarity of them to the current graduate student status page varies. Two users haven’t used that page to schedule their graduation yet while another two users have already used it for their graduation. There are also two users who don’t use that page a lot but they are pretty familiar with that page.</p>
<h4>Tasks within evaluation</h4>
    
    <table id="Tasks">
             <tr>
                <th><span>Task 1</span></th>
                <td>Check the status of degree. Identify why her graduation is not completed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Task 2</th>
                <td>Withdraw the graduation application for Spring 2016.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>Task 3 </th>
                <td>Check the status of degree 2 (similar to how you checked degree 1). </td>

            <tr>
                <th>Task 4</th>
                <td>View POS form, add course HCI 521, save and validate form and submit for approval.</td>

            <tr>
                <th>Task 5.</th>

            </tr>
        </table>
<h4>    Results</h4>
<h5>    Task Completion
</h5>
    <p>Table represents the task completion success rates for each participant. A zero (0) indicates experiencing difficulty complete task and a one (1) indicates task success.</p>
     <figure>
          <center><figcaption>Task completion of each task for each participant </figcaption></center>
          <center><img itemprop="image" src="/images/table1.png" width="600" height="200" /></center>
      </figure>
   <p> Most of tasks across different participants were successfully completed. Only task 2 (P2), task 4 (P5) and task 5 (P4) were not completed successfully right away but these participants were all able to figure that out themselves after they find over the page. Other than these tasks and participants, participants (P1), (P3), (P5) and (P6) successfully completed tasks 1 through 5. In the evaluation, many participants expressed difficulty find the graduation application button, indicating it is not very standing out on the page. Also, some expressed the navigation of the overall page, from graduate student status to graduation application as well as POS form. </p>
<h5>Subjective Assessment of System Usability </h5>
    
    <p>Table represents the results from the SUS survey. Responses are coded as follows: 1 = Strongly Disagree, 2 = Disagree, 3 = Neutral, 4 = Agree, 5 = Strongly Agree. </p>

    <figure>
          <center><figcaption>SUS score for each participant </figcaption></center>
          <center><img itemprop="image" src="/images/table2.png" width="600" height="200" /></center>
      </figure>
    &nbsp
    <figure>
          <center><figcaption>SUS score for each participant </figcaption></center>
          <center><img itemprop="image" src="/images/sus.png" width="600" height="400" /></center>
      </figure>
   <p> As represented in the SUS score table and figure, scores on the SUS questionnaire varied from a low score of 40 to a high score of 95, with m = 75. Since scores of 68 is considered average <i>(Bangor, Kortum, & Miller, 2008)</i>, the mean SUS score of 75 indicated an above average level of user satisfaction and perceived usability of <i>MyStatus</i>. Of note, the participant (P3) who experienced the most difficulty during the evaluation scored the lowest on the SUS, whereas the participant (P6) who experienced the least difficulty scored the highest score. </p>
   <h5> Net Promoter Score</h5>
    <p>NPS for MyStatus is 16.7. According to Net promoter score, There were 2 out of 6 “promoters” while 1 “detractors” in Group B. Fred calculated the average score of 400 companies across 28 industries and got the median Net Promoter Score was 16 <i>(Reichheld, 2003)</i>. According to Net Promoter Network <i><i>(Satmetrix Systems, 2015)</i></i>, the average score for software and app is 19.</p>

<p>NPS calculated for MyStatus is a little higher than the median NPS in the industry while it is a little lower than the average score for software and app is 19. However, as expressed from many of the participants, graduate student status is not like some other websites or software that are used pretty often. This page is only used a couple of times throughout the graduate study for each graduate student. The function of this page may influence the score participants rate. </p> 
    <h5>Qualitative Data</h5>
    <p>At the end of questionnaire, each participant was asked to complete the following open-ended questions.</p>
<article class=
        "function"><ul>    <li>What did you like about the system?</li>
<li>What parts were confusing?</li>
<li>Do you have suggestions for improvement?</li></ul></article>
    <p>Qualitative data gathered during the test questionnaire and is summarized in the Table below. </p>

<h4>Usability problems and solutions</h4>
    <p>After analyzing the data from the usability evaluation sessions, several problems were identified that needed attention. Table 5 displays the problems and the proposed solutions. The sequence indicates from most severe to less severe.</p>
