        <h2>USERS</h2>

        <h4>Primary Users</h4>
        <p>The main users are graduate students at Iowa State University, no matter how many majors they are pursuing, whether they are thesis or non-thesis students, whether they are online or on campus students.</p>
        <h4>Secondary Users</h4>
        <p>The secondary users are faculty and staff who need to instruct their students. For example, the advisors of graduate students need to use Graduate Student Status to know their studying progress so that they know how to give them useful instructions.</p>
        <h4>The Focus of the Study</h4>
        <p>The focus of this study is the overall graduate students. Although secondary stakeholders are faculties and staffs, some other people can be influenced such as IT staff who work on this system, the most popular user group are graduate students. Since they interact with this system most often, and it is critically important for them to be on top of all the process and paperwork of graduation. </p>
        <h4>User Study</h4>
        <p>The three users used to understand the problems are three graduate students in different majors. The ways to interact with them are interviews and observations. They were asked to perform the tasks and used think out loud technique <i>(Dix, Finlay, Abowd, & Beale, 2007)</i> to speak out what are their pain points using current pages.</p>
&nbsp
        <h2>USER TASKS</h2>
        &nbsp

        <p>The three users performed three main tasks. The hierarchical task analysis <i>(Muth, Glynn, Britton, & Graves, 1988)</i> for each main task was used to analyze the tasks (see below).</p>
